Linux kernel tryout 2.6.22.19-Kharel 

This is the linux kernel modified for the course CS370.

The initial kernel source was downloaded from cs543's modified version of 
the original kernel to make it more easier to install in a kvm in Drexel tux 
server.

For the config, the config file was downloaded from Professor Bill Mongan's 
resources, which is https://www.cs.drexel.edu/~wmm24/cs370/resources/config-2.6.22.19-debian

Kernel Debugger was also installed using these files:
kdb-v4.4-2.6.22-rc7-common-1.bz2 and kdb-v4.4-2.6.22-rc7-i386-1.bz2 and kdb-v4.4-2.6.22-rc7-x86_64-1.bz2 (external links, no guarantees!) from http://oss.sgi.com/projects/kdb/.

The Build process:
	make EXTRAVERSION='.19-KHAREL' -j8
Which then build a file at arch/x86_64/boot/bzimage

And to boot the custom kernel:
	kvm -curses -kernel arch/x86_64/boot/bzImage -append 'root=/dev/hda1 ro' -drive file=../local.qcow2 --redir tcp:2222::22

The main.c under init was modified to print "Hello World from Me" if passed 'printme parameter while booting the kernel. 
Example:
 kvm -curses -kernel arch/x86_64/boot/bzImage -append 'root=/dev/hda1 ro printme' -drive file=../local.qcow2 --redir tcp:2222::22
